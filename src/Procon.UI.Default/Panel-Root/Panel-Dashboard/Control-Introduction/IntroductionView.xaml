        Hello guys.  I just wanted to put a big block of text here that will probably have a snazzy Procon 2 logo next to it in the future.
        Just in-case you're wondering, the fancy resizing text will probably go on the top right corner of this area Phogue.  Totally a rip off.
        Let's see.  Silly Sally went down to the sea shore to find some sea shells.  Peter piper picked a peck of pickled peppers.  Jack and Jill...
        I guess since this has a giant Procon 2 logo next to it now, it doesn't really matter that I said I should place one earlier in this paragraph.
        However, I've gotta hide it behind something now... cause it only looks cool when it's hidden.  Maybe if I'm lazy enough, I'll just get them to
        edit the photo to make it look like it's hiding.
    </TextBlock>
